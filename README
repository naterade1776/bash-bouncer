Hello! Thank you for choosing Bash-Bouncer. Just so you know, I am very much green and would not be at all surprised if this
turns out to be a massive flop. I'm open to suggestions and feedback.

To use the script, you will need to edit the {bash.bashrc} config file with root permissions. 

First, open the script and type
your desired credentials where it says "put your name here". If you don't want your machine to power off for every incorrect 
spelling or unauthorized attempt, replace {poweroff} with your command of choice. Just make sure it will do something to 
prevent an unauthorized user from interacting with the terminal.

To impliment the script, navigate to {/etc/bash.bashrc}. 

Type: { sudo nano bash.bashrc }

Find the line indicated in figure1_1.png and paste the script you edited there. The result should look like figure2_1.png.

Save the file and the next time you open a terminal or use a remote shell on that machine, it will require the name you set in
the bash-bouncer script.
